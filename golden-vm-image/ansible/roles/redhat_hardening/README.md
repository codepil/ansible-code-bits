RHEL Hardening 
======================

Most of the hardening is from CIS Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7/8 Benchmark v1.0.1 - 05-19-2021  https://www.cisecurity.org/.

This role **will make changes to the system** that could break things. This is not an auditing tool but rather a remediation tool to be used after an audit has been conducted.

This role was developed against a clean install of the Redhat 7 or 8 Operating System. 
If you are implementing to an existing system please review this role for any site specific changes that are needed.
